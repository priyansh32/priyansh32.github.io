i learned creating better responsive sites, also learned some things for better color schemes in websites, and most important I learned working on real life projects

<!-- To see how you can add code snippets, see below: -->

<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Useful resources

- [Coder Coder](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzNf0liwUzMN6_pixbQlMhQ) - This helped me adapting to a real life work style and learned a lot of things from her especially her 'Building a Website from scratch' series. I really learned a lot watching Jessica Chan aka Coder Coder on Youtube.
